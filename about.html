                   <h3>We're going somewhere</h3>
                    <p>Today, we are starting out of Lagos Nigeria with a few apartments. But our end game is to change the face of hospitality across Africa and we are doing this through standardisation and technology.</p>
                    <p>We want you to find a pumpkin in every African country you visit. Though each individual pumpkin is unique, e maintain the same unadulterated standard and unifying elements across all our apartments.</p>
                    <p>It's just like having your home in your backpack, thats the urban pumpkin feeling. </p>

                    <h3>Harnessing technology</h3>
                    <p>From check-in to check-out, your journey has minimal human interaction except you
                        expressly request for it. We've deployed a keyless entry system making your bookings
                        as seamless as can be. When you book and pay for a pumpkin apartment, you automatically
                        receive an access code which grants you access to the apartments for the number of days
                        you have booked.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you require additional services such as cleaning, you're one click away from booking
                        a cleaning slot from the easy to use concierge section of our website. Once booked,
                        a cleaning representative will be with you at your chosen time.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our chat bot function infused with the latest artificial intelligence technology is also
                        available to answer all your questions. However, for times when you would rather
                        interact with a human representative, our concierge functions connects you directly to
                        a member of our team.

                   <h3>Our Leadership</h3>
                    <p>Amanda founded Urban Pumpkin in April 2022 when she noticed a gap in the short term rental (STR) market in Nigeria. The industry was lacking standardisation with regards to STR offerings and Amanda embarked on a journey to fix this. </p>
                    <p>Before Urban Pumpkin, Amanda was Managing Director at Xenia Lifestyle, an indigenous hospitality management company focused on curating hospitality services. </p>
                    <p>Amanda holds two MSc degrees in Disruptive Innovation and International Marketing, both from Hult International Business School, where she graduated with dual distinctions and a BSc. in Finance from the University of Lagos.</p>
